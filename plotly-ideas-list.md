# Plotly GSoC 2019

# Build interactive analytic applications in pure Python  
[Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) is an open-source Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required. Built on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical Python code.

As a participant, you will bring your specific knowledge and passion to the table, working alongside the creators of Dash to design and build interactive analytic applications using the Dash library.

Dash is a flexible framework and a Dash app can take almost any form.
The kinds of apps you build will depend on your background and skills.
For inspiration, check out some **existing demo apps** from our [Dash gallery](https://dash.plot.ly/gallery):
 - Finance: [CRM app](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-salesforce-crm) | [Source code](https://github.com/plotly/dash-salesforce-crm)
 - Energy: [Natural gas production tracking app](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-oil-and-gas) | [Source code](https://github.com/plotly/dash-oil-and-gas-demo)
 - Life sciences: [Drug discovery app](https://dash-drug-explorer.plot.ly/?_ga=2.257288654.43244547.1547656018-533022584.1547656018) | [Source code](https://github.com/plotly/dash-drug-discovery-demo/)
 - Deep learning: [Model training visualization app](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-live-model-training) | [Source code](https://github.com/plotly/dash-live-model-training)
